**Access Key and Secret Key Creation**

After selecting your IAM user, locate Access Key 1 on the right side of the screen, and click Create Access Key just below it.

On the next page, several options are available for creating an access key. For simplicity, select Other by checking the corresponding box, and proceed by clicking Next.

You will then reach the Set Description Tag page. No additional input is required here, so simply click Create Access Key. This will generate both the Access Key and Secret Key for your IAM user.
