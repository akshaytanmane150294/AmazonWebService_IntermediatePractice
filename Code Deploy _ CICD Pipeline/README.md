**Code Deploy / CICD Pipeline**

**1)  Create a CodeDeploy Application**

Navigate to CodeDeploy and click Create Application.

Application Name: demo-app-application

Compute Platform: EC2

Select Create Application to save the setup.

Next, on the same page, select Create Deployment Group.

Deployment Group Name: demo-app-application-group

**Service Role: Attach a role with the following policies:**

        AmazonEC2FullAccess
        AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy
        AmazonS3FullAccess
        AWSCodeDeployFullAccess
        AWSCodeDeployRole
        
Attach the **roleâ€™s ARN** to Service Role in the deployment group configuration.

Deployment Type: In-Place

Environment Configuration: Amazon EC2

Create a new EC2 instance named demo-app-ec2.

Key Name: Add tags with key Name and value demo-app-ec2.

**2)  Install the CodeDeploy Agent**

The CodeDeploy Agent manages deployments by listening to deployment instructions and executing tasks like file copying and service restarts.

Connect to your EC2 instance and run the following bash script to install the CodeDeploy agent:

bash

**Copy code**

    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt --fix-broken install
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ruby3.0
    cd /home/ubuntu
    wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
    chmod +x ./install
    sudo ./install auto
    sudo service codedeploy-agent start
    sudo systemctl status codedeploy-agent

Verify the us-east-1 region in the URL matches your deployment region.

**3)  Project Directory Setup**

Within your project directory, create a folder named scripts, and add the following files:

**start_nginx.sh:**

bash

**Copy code**

    #!/bin/bash
    sudo service nginx start
    install_nginx.sh:
    bash
    Copy code
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nginx


Create the appspec.yml file in your project root:

yaml

**Copy code**

    version: 0.0
    os: linux
    files:
      - source: /
        destination: /var/www/html/
    hooks:
      AfterInstall:
        - location: scripts/install_nginx.sh
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
      ApplicationStart:
        - location: scripts/start_nginx.sh
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
          
Commit and push these files to your CodeCommit repository.

Run CodeBuild to build your code and push artifacts to an S3 bucket. Copy the S3 bucket URL for CodeDeploy.

**4)  Create a Deployment in CodeDeploy**

In CodeDeploy, select your application and start a deployment.

Deployment Group: This will auto-populate with the deployment group name.

Revision Type: S3

Revision Location: Paste the S3 URL (e.g., s3://code-build-artifact-1209333/build-specs-folder/buildspec-output.zip).

**Ensure your EC2 instance has the necessary permissions by attaching a role with the following policies:**

    AmazonEC2FullAccess
    AmazonS3FullAccess
    AWSCodeDeployFullAccess

Test the deployment by checking the public IP of your EC2 instance in a browser.

Restart the CodeDeploy agent if necessary:

bash

**Copy code**
    
    -sudo service codedeploy-agent restart

**5)  CodePipeline Setup**

Go to CodePipeline and select Create Pipeline.

Pipeline Name: Choose a unique name.

Service Role: New Service Role

Select Next.

Configure Source:

Source Provider: AWS CodeCommit

Repository: Select the demoapp repository

Branch: master

Change Detection Options: AWS CodePipeline

Configure Build:

Build Provider: AWS CodeBuild

Project Name: demo-app-build

Build Type: Single Build

Configure Deploy:

Deploy Provider: AWS CodeDeploy

Application Name: demo-app-application

Deployment Group: demo-app-deploy-grp

Click Next to complete your pipeline configuration.

Your CodePipeline will now trigger automatically whenever changes are pushed to CodeCommit, streamlining your CI/CD process.
