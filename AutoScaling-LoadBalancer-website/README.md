**1) Configure EC2 Security Groups**

**Application Load Balancer Security Group:**

Create a security group specifically for the Application Load Balancer.

Set inbound rules to allow HTTP traffic with source: Anywhere (IPv4).

Save by clicking on Create Security Group.

AutoScaling Security Group:

Create a separate security group for AutoScaling.

Set inbound rules to allow All TCP with source set to the Application Load Balancerâ€™s security group.

Add an additional inbound rule to allow SSH with source: Anywhere (IPv4).

2) Create an EC2 AutoScaling Group

Set Up AutoScaling Group:

Navigate to AutoScaling Group and provide a name, such as DemoAutoScaling.

For the launch template, create a template named TestAutoScaling:

Application and OS Images (AMI): Choose Ubuntu from Quickstart.

Instance Type: Select t2.micro (free tier).

Key Pair: Select your SSH key pair.

Network Settings: Attach the AutoScaling security group.

User Data: Enter the following script to install and start Apache:

bash
**Copy code**

    -#!/bin/bash
    -apt-get update -y
    -apt-get install -y apache2
    -systemctl start apache2
    -systemctl enable apache2
    -echo "<html><body><h1>Apache is running on EC2 instance: $(hostname -i)</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    
Click on Launch.

Configure Subnets and Load Balancer:

In the AutoScaling Group settings, select subnets to include (e.g., Subnets 3 and 4).

Under Load Balancing, select Attach a New Load Balancer and name it, e.g., DemoAppLoadBalancer.

Set the load balancer to Internet-facing.

Create a target group, configure health checks, and proceed with the default settings.

Set Group Size and Scaling:

Configure desired capacity: Min = 1, Max = 2.

Review and complete the setup.

3) Update Load Balancer Security Group

Go to your Load Balancer settings, select Security, and change to the Application Load Balancer security group if necessary.

4) Test Load Balancer

Copy the DNS name of the Load Balancer and paste it in your browser.

You should see the message: "Apache is running on an EC2 instance."

5) Configure Automatic Scaling Policy

In the AutoScaling group, select Automatic Scaling and create a Dynamic Scaling Policy.

Set the Target Tracking Policy to monitor Average CPU Utilization with a target value of 30.

6) Verify CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch will automatically monitor the scaling conditions. Ensure CPU metrics are displayed.

7) Connect to EC2 Instance and Simulate Load

Connect to an instance in the AutoScaling group and install the stress library:

bash
**Copy code**
    -sudo apt install stress -y

Run a stress test to increase CPU load:

bash
**Copy code**

    -sudo stress --cpu 12 --timeout 240s

Monitor the Stress Process:

Check for active stress processes:
bash
**Copy code**

    -ps aux | grep stress

Use the kill command to stop a specific process:

bash
**Copy code**
    -kill -9 <process_id>

8) Verify Scaling

Monitor CloudWatch to ensure the condition (CPU > 30%) triggers scaling.
Confirm new instances are created automatically in response to CPU load, and check if they appear in the AutoScaling group.
Verify that the public IP changes for the instances behind the Load Balancer when scaling occurs.
